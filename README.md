# Enchantable

Enchantable is a mod that brings new and balanced enchantments to the game! It expands on aspects of the game where no vanilla enchantments provide benifits but also adds new functionality to existing gameplay. The enchantments are designed to not be overpowered to keep the vanilla feel. Currently Enchantable adds six new enchantments but more will be added over time!

### Features:

* ðŸ“— Stomping - Redirects a portion of fall damage to mobs in a five block radius (Boots only)
* ðŸ“— Iron Skull - Prevents damage caused by flying into a wall with an elytra (Helmet Only)
* ðŸ“— Replanting - Replants seeds as you break crops (Hoe only)
* ðŸ“— Cultivator - Tills a 3x3 area rather than a single block. Also works for harvesting crops. (Hoe and Shovel only)
* ðŸ“— Excavator - Allows a tool to mine/break a 3x3 or 5x5 square (Works for pickaxe, shovel and axe)
* ðŸ“— Ore Eater - Helps you mine ores faster by breaking multiple blocks at a time. THe higher the level the more ores will be broken. (Pickaxe only)
